"Get the hell out of here!" - said Jenny to her well-paid colleague on
Wednesday. "Fuck off!", - answered Peter, - "You'll never know how much
pain I feel about it! You are psycho! All that glisters is not gold. This
job will put gold right in my pocket while you think it's shit. Boss said
I can increase my income twice. I am not going to pay attention to this.
Well, I am not afraid. I have spent eight hard-working years here and I
know I am going to find better opportunity. Perhaps, I can never go
back." - said Peter and left the room. Jenny's record of Peter's speech
will show who is right.
